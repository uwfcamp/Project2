FIXED * client must be notified when file they are trying to download doesn't exist, but client just freezes.

FIXED * group chat is not updating with new messages until the user hits enter

FIXED * mutex lock unlocks in the wrong place in private chat, if user types _q, it stays locked

FIXED * after client was kicked, it would have errors after relogging back in. it was fixed by 
adding a sem_wait() and acknowledgement response from the server when logging out. 

FIXED * after admin boots person, if the person was logged in. they wouldnt be forced off. A critical
pointer was left unitialized which prevented ban notification from being sent to online user.
