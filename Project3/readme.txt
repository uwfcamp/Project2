I. SETUP AND COMPILATION

  1.  Download and unzip the submission folder from eLearning onto a Linux testing environtment
  
  2.  This sumbission should contain the following:
    - client_framework.c
    - client_framework.h
    - server_framework.c
    - server_framework.h
    - makefile
    - Definitions.h
    - readme.txt (this file)
    
  3.  Environment: This program was developed and tested in Linux. It was also tested in the
      multiplatform environment.
      
  4.  Compiling: This program contains a makefile. At the command line in Linux omitting the
      quotes("), type the command "make". This command will produce two executable files named
      "server" and "client". "server" is an executable that runs the server side of the project 
      description and "client" is an executable that runs the client side of the project 
      description. After successful compilation. Put the client executable in a separate 
      directory from the server(This will be mentioned a few times to make sure this is done).


II. RUNNING THE PROGRAM

  1.  server: 
      
  2.  client: 
      
III. USER INPUT

  1.  server:
  
  2.  client:
  
IV. OUTPUT

  1.  server:
  
  2.  client:
